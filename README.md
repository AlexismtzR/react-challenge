# React challenge

The project is made up of 2 main components, the first is social where the information of the posts and comments of the api is obtained using fetch and the posts are rendered, the second component is the post which basically describes the view of The posts and renders the comments if we click the comments button (the api of the posts did not show username or image, it was assumed that all the posts were written by myself and a representative photo of the user was used), both components are functional components and hooks were used to manage the state and the life cycle of the components, the redux library was also integrated and it was used to save the user's comment, to test the components the enzyme library was used with jest and 2 tests were done to verify that the components were rendering without problem.
